# Celo Helpa

## Description
Helpa is a marketplace for freelancers and clients. Freelancers showcase their service and clients get to hire them.

Numbers of projects completed from clients would be used as metrics for determining outstanding freelancers.

Freelancers would request for a review from the client after finishing a job. Client hits the approve button for payout to be made to the customer.

Clients and freelancers can see all the records of their transactions and their status respectively.

In the case of dispute, definition of done would be revisited. This feature is beyond the scope of this tutorial though.

* Freelancers can create account
* Freelancers can view their past jobs
* Clients can view their past transactions
* Freelancer can mark transactions as completed for review
* Clients can approve transactions, afterwards, fund is released for job done.
